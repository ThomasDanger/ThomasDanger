### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#Thomas Conner
`Software Engineering Student`

I am an undergraduate student currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering 
at the University of Texas at Dallas. I have been programming since the age of ten but, in the
past three years, I have trully fallen in love with it. I have a strong understanding of data
structures and algorithms, assembly language, procedural programming, and object-oriented
programming.
